# SVD Files Description

The SVD files needed for the debugger to provide SoC's register information in
your debugger viewer window. 

Currently only `stm32` `SVD` files used. But you're welcome to add your own!

## 1. STM32 SVD Files

### 1.1 STM32H745 SoC SVD Files
At the moment only two SVD files for 'STM32H745 SoC` are present in this folder:
* STM32H745_CM7.svd - needed for debug of Cortex-M7 core
* STM32H745_CM4.svd - needed for debug of Cortex-M4 core
